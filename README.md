HTML5 Loop-station

This is a 4 track real-time loopstation made in Javascript and HTML5, utilising the webkit javascript audio methods and HTML5 audio attributes

It might be a little laggy on your system if you don't have equipment capable of delivering lag free input.

I know it works essentially flawlessly on OSX devices

More commits to come in the future
